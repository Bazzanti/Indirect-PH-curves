This repository is about Indirect PH Curves, a way to draw them in Matlab and confront them with quintic curves with Pythagorean hodographs.


## About Indirect PH Curves
Planar Bézier curves that have rationally parameterized offsets can be classified into two classes. The first
class is composed of curves that have Pythagorean hodographs (PH) and the second class is composed
of curves that do not have PHs but can have rational PHs after reparameterization by a fractional
quadratic transformation. 

We have derived the geometric characteristics of a class of
cubic Bézier curves, called indirect-PH curves, which are not PH
curves but can have rational Pythagorean hodographs after a
quadratic parameter transformation. The characteristics are given
in terms of Bézier control polygon geometry. The offsets to this
class of Bézier curves are generally degree 8 rational curves. The
construction of G1 Hermite interpolation using such curves is
described. A single cubic indirect-PH curve has just one more
degree of freedom than a quadratic Bézier curve, but bi-indirect-
PH curves possess enough flexibility for G1 Hermite interpolation
and shapes containing an inflection point.
